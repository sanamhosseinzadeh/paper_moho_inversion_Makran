# Folder Structure and File Descriptions

This folder contains the datasets, R scripts, and GMT codes used in the section titled  **CRUST1.0 Synthetic Data** of the manuscript. 
The materials are organized into subfolders for forward modeling and inversion. 
Each folder is self-contained, with the corresponding data, scripts, and results provided for transparency and reproducibility.
All resulting figures are saved in their respective folder for easy access.

## forward/  
This folder contains the scripts, data, results, and figures related to the forward gravity modeling process.

- `R_scripts/Forward.R`: R script to generate the noisy CRUST1.0 synthetic gravity data from the Moho model.  
Note: The script contains paths that must be updated to match your system before running.  
- `results/CRUST1_NSynthetic_Data.csv`: Output noisy CRUST1.0 synthetic gravity data generated by the forward model.  
- `figures_GMT_scripts/figure5a_map_Simple_Moho_Model/a_map.bat`: GMT script to map the CRUST1.0 synthetic Moho model (Figure 5a).

 ## Reproducibility Note

- The synthetic gravity data were generated by adding randomly simulated noise within the R script.  
Because the noise is created using a random process without a fixed seed, rerunning the forward modeling script may produce slightly different noisy data.  
As a result, the inversion results — including estimated Moho depths and residuals — may also differ slightly from those presented in the paper.  

- The results obtained from the inversion process can vary due to the random nature of the hybrid DE/PSO metaheuristic algorithm.  
Since no fixed seed was set, running the inversion code multiple times may lead to slightly different outcomes, such as variations in the estimated Moho depths and residuals.

The exact figures and values presented in the paper can be reproduced using the provided `.csv`, `.RData`, and output files included in this folder.
