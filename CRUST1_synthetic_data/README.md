# Folder Structure and File Descriptions

This folder contains the datasets, R scripts, and GMT codes used in the section titled "CRUST1.0 Synthetic Data" of the paper. 
The materials are organized into subfolders for forward modeling and inversion. 
Each folder is self-contained, with the corresponding data, scripts, and results provided for transparency and reproducibility.
All resulting figures are saved in their respective folder for easy access.

### forward/  
This folder contains the scripts, data, results, and figures related to the forward gravity modeling process.

- `data/CRUST1_Moho_Model.csv`: Input file defining the CRUST1.0 synthetic Moho model.  
- `R_scripts/Forward.R`: R script to generate the noisy CRUST1.0 synthetic gravity data from the Moho model.  
Note: The script contains paths that must be updated to match your system before running.  
- `results/CRUST1_NSynthetic_Data.csv`: Output noisy CRUST1.0 synthetic gravity data generated by the forward model.  
- `figures_GMT_scripts/figure5a_map_Simple_Moho_Model/a_map.bat`: GMT script to map the CRUST1.0 synthetic Moho model (Figure 5a).  
- `figures_GMT_scripts/figure5a_map_Simple_Moho_Model/b_map.bat`: GMT script to map the CRUST1.0 synthetic gravity data (Figure 5b).  
## Usage
1- run `R_scripts/Forward.R`
- **Input:** `data/CRUST1_Moho_Model.csv`
- **Output:** `CRUST1_NSynthetic_Data.csv`

2- run `figures_GMT_scripts/figure5a_map_Simple_Moho_Model/a_map.bat`
  - **Input:** `a.txt` that is the txt file of `data/CRUST1_Moho_Model.csv`


3- run `figures_GMT_scripts/figure5a_map_Simple_Moho_Model/b_map.bat`
   - **Input:** `b.txt` that is the txt file of `CRUST1_NSynthetic_Data.csv`

### inversion/  
This folder contains the scripts, data, results, and figures related to the inversion process using the hybrid DE/PSO metaheuristic algorithm.

- `data/CRUST1_Moho_Model.csv`: Input file defining the CRUST1.0 synthetic Moho model.  
- `data/CRUST1_NSynthetic_Data.csv`: Input file defining the noisy CRUST1.0 synthetic gravity data.  
- `R_scripts/Inversion_Hybrid_Main_Code.R`: Main R script to perform the inversion and save results in the `Log/` folder.  
Note: The script contains paths that must be updated to match your system before running.  
- `results/log/P150it5tmax300.log`, `run1.RData`, `P150it5tmax300.pdf`: Output files from the inversion.  
- `results/figure5c_map_GMT_scripts/c_map.bat`: GMT script to map the estimated Moho depths (Figure 5c).  
- `results/figure5d_map_GMT_scripts/d_map.bat`: GMT script to map the calculated data (Figure 5d).  
- `results/figure5e_map_GMT_scripts/e_map.bat`: GMT script to map the Moho depth residuals (Figure 5e).  
- `results/figure5f_map_GMT_scripts/f_map.bat`: GMT script to map the data residuals (Figure 5f).  
- `results/figure6_plots_R_scripts/Figure6_Plots_R_scripts.R`: R script to plot Figure 6.  
Note: Open the `run1.RData` file first, then run this script. It uses the saved workspace variables.  
- `results/output_files_R_scripts/Output_Files_R_scripts.R`: R script to generate `.csv` files containing the inversion results.  
Note: Open the `run1.RData` file first, then run this script. It uses the saved workspace variables.

 ## Reproducibility Note

- The synthetic gravity data were generated by adding randomly simulated noise within the R script.  
Because the noise is created using a random process without a fixed seed, rerunning the forward modeling script may produce slightly different noisy data.  
As a result, the inversion results — including estimated Moho depths and residuals — may also differ slightly from those presented in the paper.  

- The results obtained from the inversion process can vary due to the random nature of the hybrid DE/PSO metaheuristic algorithm.  
Since no fixed seed was set, running the inversion code multiple times may lead to slightly different outcomes, such as variations in the estimated Moho depths and residuals.

The exact figures and values presented in the paper can be reproduced using the provided `.csv`, `.RData`, and output files included in this folder.
