# Folder Structure and File Descriptions

This folder contains the datasets, R scripts, and GMT codes used in the section titled "Simple Synthetic Data" of the paper. 
The materials are organized into subfolders for forward modeling and inversion. 
Each folder is self-contained, with the corresponding data, scripts, and results provided for transparency and reproducibility.
All resulting figures are saved in their respective folder for direct access.

### forward/  
This folder contains the scripts, data, results, and figures related to the forward gravity modeling process.

- `data/Simple_Moho_Model.csv`: Input file defining the simple synthetic Moho model.  
- `R_scripts/Forward.R`: R script to compute the synthetic gravity data from the Moho model.  
Note: The script contains paths that must be updated to match your system before running.  
- `results/Simple_Synthetic_Data.csv`: Output synthetic gravity data generated by the forward model.  
- `figures_GMT_scripts/figure3a_map_Simple_Moho_Model/a_map.bat`: GMT script to map the simple synthetic Moho model (Figure 3a).  
- `figures_GMT_scripts/figure3a_map_Simple_Moho_Model/b_map.bat`: GMT script to map the simple synthetic gravity data (Figure 3b).  

### inversion/  
This folder contains the scripts, data, results, and figures related to the inversion process using the hybrid DE/PSO metaheuristic algorithm.

- `data/Simple_Moho_Model.csv`: Input file defining the simple synthetic Moho model.  
- `data/Simple_Synthetic_Data.csv`: Input file defining the synthetic gravity data.  
- `R_scripts/Inversion_Hybrid_Main_Code.R`: Main R script to perform the inversion and save results in the `Log/` folder.  
Note: The script contains paths that must be updated to match your system before running.  
- `results/log/P150it5tmax300.log`, `run1.RData`, `P150it5tmax300.pdf`: Output files from the inversion.  
- `results/figure3c_map_GMT_scripts/c_map.bat`: GMT script to map the estimated Moho depths (Figure 3c).  
- `results/figure3d_map_GMT_scripts/d_map.bat`: GMT script to map the calculated data (Figure 3d).  
- `results/figure3e_map_GMT_scripts/e_map.bat`: GMT script to map the Moho depth residuals (Figure 3e).  
- `results/figure3f_map_GMT_scripts/f_map.bat`: GMT script to map the data residuals (Figure 3f).  
- `results/figure4_plots_R_scripts/Figure4_Plots_R_scripts.R`: R script to plot Figure 4.  
Note: Open the `run1.RData` file first, then run this script. It uses the saved workspace variables.  
- `results/output_files_R_scripts/Output_Files_R_scripts.R`: R script to generate `.csv` files containing the inversion results.  
Note: Open the `run1.RData` file first, then run this script. It uses the saved workspace variables.
